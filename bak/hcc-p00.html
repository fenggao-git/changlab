<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="4">Professor Chang is interested in spatial and temporal
dynamics in hydrodynamics, reaction-diffusion systems, surfactant aggregation,
molecular dynamics, thermal ignition and electrochemical dissolution. Current
projects include wave dynamics on falling films, mass/heat transfer and
reaction enhancement due to chaotic and turbulent mixing, contact-line
dynamics, soliton bifurcations, molecular diffusion in zeolites, molecular
lubricant design, nanofabrication by electrodissolution instabilities,
flow transition in multi-phase channel flow, modification of classical
transition-state reaction and transport theory using Hamiltonian dynamics,
ignition of catalytic converters and stability of reverse-flow reactors.</font>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His approach is analytical in most
cases with some supporting numerical and experimental components. Perturbation,
bifurcation and matched asymptotic analyses are used to decipher the proper
scaling laws, the pertinent physics and chemistry and the pattern selection
mechanism.</font>
<p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His group has deciphered the dynamics
of wave evolution on a falling film and attributed downstream wave texture
coarsening to a unique irreversible wave coalescence phenomenon that is
quite distinct from the classical interaction between solitons of conservative
systems. He has revealed a dominant mechanism for rivulet formation during
film coating involving a transition from rolling to sliding motion. His
group has also applied nonlinear wave theory to analyze atomization, slug
formation and wave-induced enhanced transports in multi-phase flow systems.
Renormalization techniques are used to obtain effective mass transport
in turbulent flow and random media.&nbsp; He has determined that the major
stochastic driving force in molecular diffusion through zeolites is low-frequency
acoustic lattice vibration and has derived an explicit expression for the
infinite-dilution diffusivity. He has examined the effect of two-phase
thermal dispersion on reactor stability and ignition of catalytic converters.
Another&nbsp; work promises to decipher the dynamics of pattern formation
during metal dissolution in an electrolyte solution.
