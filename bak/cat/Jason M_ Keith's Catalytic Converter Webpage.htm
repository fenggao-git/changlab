<H3>A Novel Catalytic Converter Re-design for Rapid Ignition </H3></CENTER>
<CENTER>Presented at AIChE National Conference, Dallas, TX, 11/99<BR>In 
Preparation for submission to AIChE Journal 
<P></CENTER>The catalytic converter used today is cold and ineffective during 
the first three minutes after a car is started. A design will be presented here 
which shortens this transient period during cold starts and hence drastically 
reduces pollution emissions. Because the current monolith is designed to 
maximize interphase heat transfer, there is very little thermal dispersion. As a 
result, a thermal front remains sharp as it travels down the monolith and 
ignition occurs at this front near the exit of the converter. This down-stream 
ignition position renders the ignition sensitive to flow rate fluctuations that 
may push the ignition zone out of the converter and extinguish it. In contrast, 
if the interphase heat transfer is diminished, a large Taylor-Aris thermal 
dispersion arises, and a much more robust leading-edge ignition will take place 
in the converter. This preferred ignition position also allows convection to 
light off the remaining monolith whereas downstream ignition can only do so 
through the slow process of upstream thermal diffusion. <BR><BR>The earlier 
analytical theory of Leighton and Chang (AIChE J., vol. 41, p. 1898 (1995)) for 
a step thermal front explicitly and qualitatively delineates these two different 
ignition behaviors with a single dimensionless parameter that is a ratio between 
the square of the axial convection and axial dispersion length scales during the 
homogeneous time for ignition. Numerical simulations confirm this desirable 
leading-edge ignition under realistic transient driving conditions, and an 
effective re-design of the current catalytic converter system is proposed. To 
facilitate the design, the theoretical model of Leighton and Chang has been 
modified to predict the ignition time and location for any catalytic converter 
design under transient start-up conditions. <BR><BR>The re-design consists of a 
bypass stream containing an electric pre-heater and a cheap pre-igniter. By 
adjusting the fraction of gas entering the bypass and using a very low wattage 
power supply, the electric pre-heater is able to raise the gas temperature 
beyond a precise minimum determined by the analytical theory, such that the 
exiting hot gas subsequently triggers a robust and rapid leading-edge ignition 
in the pre-igniter. The heat released from CO oxidation in the pre-igniter then 
rapidly raises the temperature in the original converter, which is not removed. 
When the main converter is warm enough, the bypass through the pre-igniter is 
eliminated and the main converter lights off. Despite the added complexity, the 
bypass has two distinct advantages: prevention of poisoning at the pre-igniter, 
and reduction of the required power input to the electric pre-heater to the 
extent that an extra power supply is not required. <BR><BR>The analytical theory 
is used to optimize the key design parameter, the power supply to the electric 
pre-heater. The optimal design is shown to reduce the light-off time to 12 
seconds, reducing pollution of CO and NO by over 90%, and reducing non-methane 
hydrocarbon pollution by almost 100% over the current converter when it is 
equipped with an optional hydrocarbon trap. Verification of the optimal design, 
which easily beats ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) standards while requiring 
only a 1200 W power supply and 4 W-h of energy, is obtained through numerical 
simulation of the Federal Test Procedure (FTP) driving test and various 
transient emission histories. Experiments will also be carried out on a Honda 
Civic to verify the validity of the new design. <BR><BR>

figure shows numerical simulation results for the catalytic converter with a 
feed temperature of 600 K and with 2% CO in the exhaust. Each line corresponds 
to a snapshot of solid phase temperatures in the catalytic converter taken 5 
seconds apart. It is clear to see that the converter ignites at the converter 
exit in a time of about 40 seconds. This downstream ignition, which occurs when 
the gas-solid thermal equilibration time is much larger than the reaction 
timescale, has two disadvantages. <BR><BR>The first is that the ignition heat is 
wasted, as for some pollutants to be removed the entire converter must be 
ignited. It takes an additional 3-5 minutes for the process of upstream thermal 
diffusion to lightoff the rest of the converter. During this time, there may be 
high pollution levels. Secondly, the downstream ignition is believed to be 
unstable to fluctuations in mass flowrate through the catalytic converter. An 
increase in the flowrate may push the ignited zone beyond the converter exit, 
such that an ignition does not take place and pollution is high. <BR><BR>This is 
the predominant ignition mechanism in aged catalytic converters during city 
driving conditions. It occurs because over the course of the ignition time, the 
gas and solid phases reach thermal equilibrium, and the thermal front is not 
smoothed much near the point at which reaction takes place. Consequently, the 
front passes through most of the converter before the ignition takes place.

figure shows numerical simulation results for the catalytic converter with a 
feed temperature of 700 K and with 2% CO in the exhaust. Each line corresponds 
to a snapshot of solid phase temperature in the catalytic converter taken 3 
seconds apart. It is clear to see that the catalytic converter ignites at the 
entrance of the converter in less than 10 seconds. This leading-edge ignition, 
which occurs when the gas-solid thermal equilibration time is on the same order 
as the reaction time, is believed to have two advantages over the downstream 
ignition. <BR><BR>The first is that the ignition heat is used. Gas convection 
quickly lights off the rest of the converter in less than 30 seconds. The second 
advantage of leading-edge ignition is that it is stable to fluctuations in 
flowrate. No matter what the gas flowrate is, the ignition will always occur at 
the leading edge of the converter. <BR><BR>This is the predominant ignition 
mechanism in aged catalytic converters during highway driving conditions. It 
occurs because over the course of the ignition time, the gas and solid phases do 
not reach thermal equilibrium, and the thermal front is smoothed greatly near 
the point at which reaction takes place. Consequently, the ignition occurs far 
upstream of the front at the leading edge of the converter. <BR><BR><BR><BR><IMG

is a three-dimensional plot which shows simulation results of a converter 
extinction. It appears that the converter is about to ignite at the exit, but an 
increase in the mass flow rate through the converter pushes the ignited zone 
beyond the converter exit. Under these conditions, there is no pollution 
reduction. <BR><BR><BR><BR><IMG align=left height="75%"

plot shows the scaled ignition time as a function of the parameter X, which is a 
ratio of the gas-solid equilibration time to the reaction time. At high 
temperatures, the reaction time is equal to the gas-solid equilibration time 
(such that X = 3.0 when T = 750 K). Theoretical predictions of the ignition time 
compare well with the simulation results, where the feed temperature and 
concentration are kept constant, but the gas flowrate is allowed to fluctate at 
various periods and fluctuation amplitudes. At low temperatures, the gas-solid 
equilibration time is larger than the reaction time (such that X = 0.05 when T = 
550 K), and theoretical predictions of the ignition time do not agree with 
simulation results. In fact, a point is reached (about 560 K) where the 
converter never ignites! As the maximum temperature exiting the engine during 
city driving conditions is around this value, there is a potential of no 
ignition at all. <BR><BR><BR><BR><IMG align=left height="35%"

<BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR>To 
counter the lack of ignition during city driving, the Notre Dame catalytic 
converter was developed. It consists of a bypass channel which contains an 
electric heater and a pre-converter. The flow through the dual butterfly valve 
is controlled with two thermocouples. The flow through the bypass is adjusted so 
that the maximum temperature of the gas exiting the heater is high enough to 
lead to a stable, rapid, leading-edge ignition in the pre-converter. The key 
feature of this design is the fact that as the flowrate through the heater is 
reduced, the temperature rise exiting it increases. <BR><BR>Once the 
pre-converter ignites, the valve is ajdusted so that all of the gas flows 
through the bypass. This allows the rest of the exhaust system to heat up 
rapidly. Once the main converter is warm enough, the valve is adjusted again so 
that none of the gas enters the bypass. Since the bypass is only used during 
cold starts, the key units in the bypass will be preserved and can have long 
lifetimes without replacement. <BR><BR><BR><BR><IMG align=left height="50%"

figure shows some experimental results. The car shown above was driven to mimic 
city driving. It remained in place during a test but the engine was revved with 
transients of one minute duration at set rpm levels followed by three minute 
idling phases. <BR><BR>Shown here is a plot of relative lightoff time (lightoff 
time with new design / lightoff time of old design) as a function of the bypass 
angle. As the angle is increased, less gas is allowed to pass through the 
electric heater, which leads to higher temperature feeds to the pre-converter. A 
smaller lightoff time is expected, and is seen here for bypass angles up to 75 
degrees. For angles beyond that, there is excessive heat loss and the ignition 
time increases. <BR><BR>The results seen here indicate a reduction in the 
ignition time from 50 - 70%, which is a good improvement over the standard 
design.
