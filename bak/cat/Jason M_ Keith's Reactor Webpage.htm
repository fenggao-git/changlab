<P></CENTER>Catalytic oxidation of VOC offers several advantages over thermal 
oxidation due to the lower operating temperature and residence time. However, a 
well-designed oxidation reactor must ensure the reaction lights off under 
transient operating conditions. Instead of heating the inlet stream to achieve 
this goal, a new transient reactor has been proposed which reverses the flow 
periodically and traps the heat of reaction within the bed and within end 
recuperation beds to heat the reactants. While such reactors are now operated by 
industry, the very reason it conserves energy also reders it very unstable and 
sensitive to hot spot formation and reactor runaway. This shortcoming is now 
alleviated by cooling the reactor with internal heat exchangers. However, the 
hot spots are quite often very localized and difficult to cool and excessive 
cooling would extinguish the reactor entirely. We propose here a basic redesign 
of the packed bed with enhanced transient thermal dispersion that is only 
effective for transient operations. (Its dispersivity vanishes under 
steady-state conditions.) We had applied it earlier to induce rapid and uniform 
heating of an automobile catalytic converter (AIChE J., 41, 1898 (1995)). Here, 
we imbed steel rods and wires in an optimal configuration within the bed. The 
steel has a higher thermal capacitance than the packing, resulting in a net 
dispersion of thermal flow due to the widely different thermal front velocities 
near the packing and the steel inserts. By sacrificing about 10% of the bed 
volume, we achieve a transient bed diffusivity several times that of steel and 
we show via numerical simulation that this new design effectively removes and 
hot spot and renders the reverse-flow reactor, stable, energy-efficient and easy 
to control. <BR><BR>Experiments are also being currently performed to quantify 
thermal dispersion in fixed beds. <BR><BR>

<BR><BR><BR><BR>This figure details a numerical simulation for the reverse-flow 
reactor under lean fuel conditions. Each horizontal line corresponds to a 
snapshot of the bed as a function of time. It is clear to see the presence of an 
ignited zone inside of the bed (shown by the elevated temperature bump) which 
oscillates back and forth due to gas flow. This demonstrates the advantage of 
the reverse-flow reactor over a traditional fixed bed reactor, which would 
extinguish in a time of about 3 hours (typical thermal front residence time).

details a numerical simulation for the reverse-flow reactor under rich fuel 
conditions. Each horizontal line corresponds to a snapshot of the bed as a 
function of time. It is clear to see that there are temperature spikes which 
develop upon flow reversal. These spikes travel back and forth inside the bed 
but remain compact as the ratio of gas convection to thermal conduction is 
small. These spikes also make the bed difficult to control. This demonstrates 
the disadvantage of the reverse-flow reactor which would run away in a time of 
about 5 hours (corresponding to 5 half-cycle periods).

than the standard fixed bed reactor.
