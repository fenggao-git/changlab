Jason is a 5th year graduate student working with 
<a href="http://www.nd.edu/~chegdept/Chang96.html">
Professor Chia Chang</a> and 
<a href="http://www.nd.edu/~chegdept/Leighton96.html">
Professor David Leighton</a>.
Jason's research interests are in the general
areas of pollution prevention, fluid mechanics,
and reaction engineering. He is also active in
teaching at Notre Dame and is currently teaching
a prototype course for 
<a href=http://www.cse.nd.edu/academics/eg111//www/index.html>
freshman engineering</a>. He expects to defend
his doctoral dissertation in the middle of 2000
and is looking for either an academic or industrial
research position.

Design of Fast-Igniting Catalytic Converter Systems</a></li>
<br><br>
Numerical results have shown that older catalytic
converters may never ignite during city driving
conditions, which may explain high pollution levels
in congested areas such as Los Angeles or Houston.
However, further results indicate that the 
same converters ignite rapidly when vehicles are
at highway speeds.
This is due to the presence of a large Taylor-Aris
thermal dispersion mechanism which smooths a hot
thermal front as it enters the cold converter
during vehicle start-up, such that the ignition
occurs at the leading edge of the converter.
This mechanism does not exist during city driving as 
the gas and solid equilibrate rapidly such that near the thermal
front, there is no smoothing. This results in 
a downstream ignition which is proportional to 
the mass flowrate through the exhaust.
For typical city driving, fluctuations 
actually extinguish any potential ignition.<br><br>
These fundamental concepts in fluid mechanics and
reaction engineering are utilized here to design a new 
catalytic converter system.
The new design, which has an added bypass channel,
an electrically heated converter, and a pre-converter
has been shown in an experimental prototype to reduce the ignition 
time by over a factor of two compared with the 
current converter.
Numerical simulations of an optimized system indicate
a potential for a more dramatic pollution reduction.

Design of Thermally Stable Reverse-Flow Reactors</a></li>
<br><br>
In the chemical industry, fixed bed reactors have been
utilized more frequently for pollutant removal due to
inexpensive operating costs.
However, extended lean periods where there is no fuel
may extinguish the bed.
Consequently, the flow of gas through the bed is reversed
periodically to maintain a bed in an ignited state.
These reactors have not been used much in industry, however,
because of their potential to exhibit thermal runaway
as very sharp temperature spikes form in the bed 
during rich feed conditions.
<br><br>
The fixed bed reactor is redesigned here by placing cylindrical
metal rods in an ordered pattern within the bed.
This allows for a transient Taylor-Aris thermal
dispersivity to develop which smooths the energy
in the temperature spikes throughout the bed.
A theoretical model has been developed to predict
the performance of such high-dispersion reverse-flow
reactors during rich and lean conditions.
Design criteria have also been developed which
determine the optimal metal rod size, spacing, 
and reversal time for any chemical reaction.
The resulting bed can operate over twenty times
longer than their current industrial counterparts.
