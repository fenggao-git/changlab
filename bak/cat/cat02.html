<font color="#000080"><font size=+2>A New High Dispersion Design of Reverse-Flow
Reactors for Volatile Organic Compounds</font></font></h3></center>
<font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Catalytic oxidation of VOC offers several
advantages over thermal oxidation due to the lower operating temperature
and residence time. However, a well-designed oxidation reactor must ensure
the reaction lights off under transient operating conditions. Instead of
heating the inlet stream to achieve this goal, a new transient reactor
has been proposed which reverses the flow periodically and traps the heat
of reaction within the bed and within end recuperation beds to heat the
reactants. While such reactors are now operated by industry, the very reason
it conserves energy also reders it very unstable and sensitive to hot spot
formation and reactor runaway. This shortcoming is now alleviated by cooling
the reactor with internal heat exchangers. However, the hot spots are quite
often very localized and difficult to cool and excessive cooling would
extinguish the reactor entirely. We propose here a basic redesign of the
packed bed with enhanced transient thermal dispersion that is only effective
for transient operations. (Its dispersivity vanishes under steady-state
conditions.) We had applied it earlier to induce rapid and uniform heating
of an automobile catalytic converter (AIChE J., 41, 1898 (1995)). Here,
we imbed steel rods and wires in an optimal configuration within the bed.
The steel has a higher thermal capacitance than the packing, resulting
in a net dispersion of thermal flow due to the widely different thermal
front velocities near the packing and the steel inserts. By sacrificing
about 10% of the bed volume, we achieve a transient bed diffusivity several
times that of steel and we show via numerical simulation that this new
design effectively removes and hot spot and renders the reverse-flow reactor,
stable, energy-efficient and easy to control.</font></font>
<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>Experiments are also being currently
performed to quantify thermal dispersion in fixed beds.</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>This figure details a numerical simulation
for the reverse-flow reactor under lean fuel conditions. Each horizontal
line corresponds to a snapshot of the bed as a function of time. It is
clear to see the presence of an ignited zone inside of the bed (shown by
the elevated temperature bump) which oscillates back and forth due to gas
flow. This demonstrates the advantage of the reverse-flow reactor over
a traditional fixed bed reactor, which would extinguish in a time of about
3 hours (typical thermal front residence time).</font></font>

<p><font face="Arial"><font size=+1>This figure details a numerical simulation
for the reverse-flow reactor under rich fuel conditions. Each horizontal
line corresponds to a snapshot of the bed as a function of time. It is
clear to see that there are temperature spikes which develop upon flow
reversal. These spikes travel back and forth inside the bed but remain
compact as the ratio of gas convection to thermal conduction is small.
These spikes also make the bed difficult to control. This demonstrates
the disadvantage of the reverse-flow reactor which would run away in a
time of about 5 hours (corresponding to 5 half-cycle periods).</font></font>

Each horizontal line corresponds to a snapshot of the bed as a function
of time. It is clear to see that the temperature spikes which develop upon
flow reversal are now smoothed throughout the bed. In fact, a cyclic steady
state develops in the bed after about 100 hours, and the reactor does not
experience runaway. This demonstrates the superiority of the reverse-flow
reactor over its traditional counterpart.</font></font>
