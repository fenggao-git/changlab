  Film</font></b> 
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">Falling film is an excellent prototype for open-flow extended-domain
systems&nbsp; that are convectively unstable, such that inlet noise is
convected into the flow channel and triggers complex spatio-temporal evolution.
Typical downstream spatio-temporal patterns and the key mechanisms behind
their transitions are examined here for the falling film. A generic wave
evolution sequence is found for large Kapitsa numbers and moderate Reynolds
numbers (<i>5&lt; R&lt;100</i>). The extent this sequence is completed depends
on the noise amplitude and the channel length but is practically independent
of the noise statistics.</font>

<p><font size="3"><b>Snapshot of the evolving waves from a numerical simulation

is placed at the inlet and a 'soft' boundary condition is placed at the exit to
minimize upstream feedback from there.</b></font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; Using a Fourier-Laplace transform theory for convective
instability, inlet white noise of a falling film is shown to be filtered downstream into wave-packets with a specific
low modulation frequency. The power spectral density hence exhibits two
dominant frequencies connected with the fastest growing mode from the primary
instability and the
<br>the secondary instability of the least unstable finite-amplitude periodic
wave. The latter is deciphered from a Floquet analysis of the quasi-stationary
periodic waves.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; Further nonlinear wave-packet dynamics of quasi-saturated
waves are dominated by a coarse-grain translational mode for wave node conservation and a Galilean mass conservation mode
corresponding to the local average film height. Such dynamics are described
by two coupled nonlinear first-order PDE's and is driven physically by
a side-band instability due to a coupling between wave modes of the two
dominant frequencies. Eventually, this ill-posed&nbsp; elliptic Cauchy
problem leads to self-similar finite-time blow-up solutions. These singularities
represent wave sinks at the modulation minima that coalesce nearby waves&nbsp;
into larger and localized wave structures called solitary pulses. Subsequent
wave dynamics are dominated by these coherent structures.</font>

<p><b>Comparison with the photographs of Kapitza.</b>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">The first pulses formed at the modulation minima are larger and faster
than the pulses form subsequently. An irreversible coalescence between
these large defect pulses and their smaller front neighbors is the key
mechanism that drives the observed pulse coarsening dynamics. The binary interaction precipitates
cascaded coalescences downstream to reduce the pulse density linearly with
distance . This downstream coarsening rate is captured with a statistical
theory that exploits the self-similarity of the pulse solution with respect
to affine scalings in substrate thickness and amplitude&nbsp; and with
a weighted spectral theory for pulses. The weighted spectral theory allows us
to collapse the continuum of essential modes of the pulse into a single discrete resonance pole. Two-dimensional pulse
dynamics cease when an equilibrium average pulse separation is reached such that an excited
pulse formed after a coalescence event cannot capture its neighbor to perpetuate
the coalescence. Using the resonance pole spectral theory to estimate the
liquid drainage rate from the excited pulse, we are able to determine this
equilibrium separation.</font>

2 the initial stationary pulse. Pulse 3 is the coalesced pulse.</b>
<p><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  The equilibrated two-dimensional localized coherent structures&nbsp; are robust 
  against 2D-disturbances but a Rayleigh 3D-instability causes the formation of 
  three-dimensional localized coherent structures called "scallop waves". With 
  the description of the dynamics of these 3D-solitons, we complete the theories 
  for all wave regimes and their transitions of this classical hydrodynamic instability.
