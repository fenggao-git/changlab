  Chambers</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">Despite the sub-millimeter 
  scales of micro-fluidic devices, the miniscule diffusivity of proteins and drugs 
  compounds (10-7 - 10-6 cm2/sec) stipulates that most reactions/biochemical docking 
  are diffusion limited with an excessively high diffusion time of hours to days. 
  Stirring and mixing are the usual remedies at larger scales to enhance the transport 
  rates. However, stirring is difficult for micro-devices as inertial pumping 
  and moving parts are unavailable at such scales. The group has been able to 
  generate sub-mm vortices with novel non-linear DC and AC electrokinetic mechanisms 
  that allow non-uniform surface slip velocities to drive intense micro-vortices. 
  Shown below are mm-sized conducting granules that can rattle electrophoretically 
  in the presence of a low-frequency AC field but will also carry with it two 
  intense micro-vortices shown below.These vortices reduce the mixing time of 
  two solutions from 1 hour to 1 minute. Micro-mixers driven by AC fields across 
  microfabricated electrodes have also been designed, as described in the micro-pump 
  section. </font></p>
