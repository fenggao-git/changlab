    <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="+1">An 
    AC Faradaic micropump has been developed that uses high-frequency (&gt;100 
    KHz) and strong (&gt;10 V) AC fields to induce AC Faradaic reaction on fabricated 
    electrodes. This reaction polarizes the electrode surface and produces a net 
    AC electro-osmotic flow. The Faradaic reaction is reversible and the net production 
    of ion and gas products is zero. As seen in the insert of the figure to right, 
    gas generation does not occur for voltages as high as 20 V. In contrast, DC 
    electric fields would typically generate gas bubbles at 1 V. The 50-micron 
    T-shaped electrodes shown on the left can propel the electrolyte solution 
    upto a speed of 1 mm/s, as seen on the right. Open symbols correspond to Pt 
    electrodes, a very good electrode catalyst, with growing Faradaic polarization 
    and velocity at low frequencies due to the loner reaction time. Closed symbols 
    correspond to relative inert gold electrodes whose Faradaic reaction and polarization 
    equilibrate at low frequencies. It is an electrokinetic pump without moving 
    parts and , unlike DC pumps, do not generate bubbles or produce ions. A prototype 
    micropump is can pump strong electrolytes at flow rates beyond one cc per 
    hr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

  <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;"><font size="+1">A separate 
    micro-bubble jet AC micro-pump has been developed. It uses Faradaic reaction 
    at a tip electrode to produce a train of fast moving micro-bubble train that 
    drives a liquid flow with a linear speed of 10 cm/s. The gas bubbles dissolve 
    into the solution far from the tip and do not block the flow channel. Such 
    high-speed micropump can be used for CPU cooling and liquid fuel cells.<br>

  <p align="left" style="margin-top: 0;"><font size="+1">The 
    cooling of micro-devices is especially challenging due to the small coolant 
    thermal capacitance and flow rates in the micro-channels. Turbulent heat transfer 
    is unattainable nor is large heat-transfer areas. The only recourse is evaporative 
    heat transfer which uses the large heat of vaporization to compensate for 
    the small flow. However, two-phase evaporative heat transfer generates bubbles 
    which are often difficult to drive in micro-channels. We are investigating 
    a new evaporative driven flow that can transport bubbles in a closed two-phase 
    system between two thermal reservoirs. The pressure gradient within the closed 
    loop is kept to a minimum by using non-circular conduits. Bubble release is 
    preferentially directed in one particular direction of the loop by using a 
    frit that controls the evaporation location. The bubbles then drive a continuous 
    flow of evaporating and condensing bubbles between the two thermal baths without 
    significant capillary or other pressure gradients. Due to the existence of 
    the two phases within the loop, the temperature gradient is also vanishingly 
    small between the two reservoirs, representing the best possible thermal communication 
    between them. By thermally insulating these loops in the longitudinal direction, 
    we are then able to achieve maximum transeverse thermal communication between 
    the hot and cold streams but minimum longitudinal thermal communication along 
    each stream.</font></p>
