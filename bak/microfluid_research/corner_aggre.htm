<p><font size="+1">Colloids, Proteins and drug compounds often precipitate at 
  micro-channel corners. The aggregate size is often large (50 microns) and cannot 
  be explained by polarization mechanisms (DLVO and DC-Dielectrophoresis). The 
  group has discovered a long range electro-osmotic and entrainment mechanism 
  due to field leakage that is responsible for this aggregation. Optimum channel 
  design which minimizes aggregation is now being tested.</font></p>
