<p><font size="+1">Micro-fluidic devices for high-throughput drug screening, proteomics 
  and genomics could often benefit from high-density storage of the reagents. 
  One possible storage device is a matrix of micro-size protein/reagent stains 
  on a substrate that can be easily dissolved and retrieved by an automated micro-pipette 
  system. Such a high-density protein library requires the generation of symmetric 
  and precisely located stains by evaporating micro- and nano-liter drops. We 
  have studied the fundamental mechanisms behind stain patterns left behind by 
  drops of protein, salt and polymer solutions. It is found that the first ring 
  of crystal/precipitate typically forms at the contact line due to enhanced evaporation 
  rate and unfavorable thermodynamics. The crystal patterns that form inwards 
  then depend on the wettability of the substrate, the thickness of the internal 
  film and the height of the first crystal ring. We find diffusion-limiting fractal 
  patterns, cratered mounds, isolated pyramids and a new dramatic annular ring 
  pattern due to a capillary wetting effects near the first ring.<br>
