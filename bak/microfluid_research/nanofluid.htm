  DC Pumps and High Throughput Nano-Spray</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have developed a nanoporous silica substrate that 
  is ideal for DC pumps and DC sprays. The silica pore size is roughly the double 
  layer thickness and hence represents the optimum pore size such that the entire 
  interstitial space is charged. The monolithic structure of the silica substrate, 
  which can be fused with a silica capillary during synthesis, also provides an 
  integral monolithic structure to sustain the large (&gt;4 atm) back pressure 
  in a DC osmotic pump. In addition, a Nafion housing design prevents bubble invasion 
  into the pumping channel. We are able to produce very large pressure that can 
  be used to pump fluid in chip scale channels and chromatographs with large hydrodynamci 
  resistance. The same high pressure is used to pressurize the meniscus at the 
  tip of the capillary such that a DC spray can be ejected from the same chip. 
  This represents the easiest interface to transfer samples between a chip and 
  a mass spectrometer. It also allows us to carry out nanotube coating of surfaces 
  by directing the charged drops to the target with an applied potential. </font></p>

<p>A silica monolith DC pump. The capilllary 
  between the two reservoirs is filled with the monolith. The ground electrode 
  is placed in the reservoir on the left and the polarized electrode in the right 
  reservoir. A Nafion housing connects the two capillaries in the right reservoir 
  to prevent bubble and ion pentration into the pumping chamber. Electrospray 
  is emitted to the right. </p>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In anticipation of nanoscale devices using nanotubes 
  and nanoporous material, the group has begun to investigate fundamental transport 
  laws at such small scales. Due to atomic and molecular interaction and because 
  the transport time scale is comparable to the surrounding thermal bath time 
  scale, the usual Fickian diffusion mechanism breaks down completely and new 
  ones must be derived. We utlize MD simulation and coarse-graining strategies 
  to derive large-scale continuum transport continuum equations for diffusion 
  in nanotubes and zeolites and surface diffusion on metals and crystals. We have 
  uncovered a new deterministic diffusion mechanism that is not driven by thermal 
  noise. Instead, a Hamiltonian chaotic trajectory results due to coupling between 
  a confined transversed degree of freedom and one or multiple longitudinal degrees 
  of freedom. The projection of the chaotic trajectory in the longitudinal direction 
  is noise like but it is not driven by any stochastic force, as shown below for 
  methane transporting in a cylindrical nanopore in a zeolite. We use KAM type 
  theories to estimate the transport rate of such deterministic diffusive mechanisms. 
  In cases when both deterministic and stochastic effects are important, we have 
  developed an RRKM type Kramer statistical theory to capture long-time tranport 
  rate due to rare-juimps through bottle necks. This latter approach requires 
  a model for the stochastic noise which we develop through short-time simulations 
  or an analytical theory for the linear lattice thermal vibrations.</font></p>
