fundamental design concepts for micron-level chemical laboratories and nanoscale
devices have been formulated and tested at the University of Notre Dame. These
include electrokinetic and pressure-driven transport mechanisms for single-phase
fluids and multi-phase fluids, channel profiling to minimize dispersion of
sample slugs, microscale mixing by asymmetric wall double-layers and electrolyte
concentration gradients, fabrication of regular <a href="../elchem/alum/pore/pore01.html">nanoscale
templates</a> by a new electrochemical pattern formation phenomenon , etching of
regimented nanoscale pores from the templates and <a href="../elchem/alum/gold/proc01.html">electrophoretic
packing of nanoscale gold colloids</a> into the pores to form miniature packed
beds. Known and postulated applications of these devices and designs will be
discussed.</font></span></p>

&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="4">Electrokinetically driven flow is a viable
means of transporting of electrolyte solutions in microlaboratories. Chemical
analysis labs, for example, are already produced by Caliper Technologies.
However, the efficiency of such devices is still limited by many transport
issues involving dispersion and mixing. Because the flow is produced by net ion
migration within thin double layers (about 100 nanometer) at the channel wall,
the electokinetic velocity is independent of the streamlines in the bulk. As
such, sample slugs tend to be stretched on the inside track of a turn where the
transit time is shorter. With finite cross-streamline diffusion, this stretching
leads to an effective streamwise Taylor-Aris dispersion that overlap the
samples. Since an optimally designed chip would require curved channels due to
space considerations, this dispersion problem must be overcome to permit a large
number of short sample slugs. We have developed a simulation package for the
electric and velocity fields in the channels and an analytical approach , using
a Hodograph transformation to conformally map the channel into a strip, to
accurately estimate the dispersion of any channel. A variational formulation
also allows us to design the optimal channel profiles to minimize dispersion. By
minimizing total curvatures and by reducing the streamwise potential gradient
and electrokinetic velocity on the inside track, a unique profile can be
produced for a given flow rate, potential drop and channel length. These
optimized profiles are then tested with macroscopic prototypes. <o:p>

&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>For
microreactors, mixing of reactants becomes a fundamental problem as high
Reynolds number turbulent or inertial mixing at usual scales do not exist. To
compound the problem, the lack of velocity gradient across streamlines in
electrokinetic flow minimizes dispersion due to convection-diffusion coupling.
We propose two new mixing mechanisms for viscous flow at micron scales. By
applying an electric field or chemical additive to one side of the channel, we
shall attempt to produce a cross-stream velocity gradient due to the asymmetric
double layer across the channel. Another mechanism is to change the electrolyte
concentrations of two merging streams such that gradients in the conductivity
exists in both the streamwise and normal directions. These gradients produce
normal flows and counter flows that combine to produce a <a href="mix-01.html">mixing
vortex in the channel</a>. Experiments with macroscopic channels indicate the
quality of mixing (the mixing time) can be improved by three orders of magnitude
with this design. <o:p>

&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="4"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Extending
electrokinetic flow to multi-phase flow can potentially apply the same
technology to non-electrolyte fluids. A non-wetting organic sample, for example,
can be transported by an electrolyte fluid around it. Air bubbles and liquid
slugs can also act as driving pistons and sample spacers. We find, however, that
multi-fluid electrokinteic flow must be designed with additional considerations.
Since the electrolyte film around the bubble or drop is smaller in cross-section
area than the full channel area behind it, the electric field, resistance and
electrokinetic velocity all increase proportionally within the film. However,
the total flow rate remains the same due to this scaling. As such, the
electrolyte film simply transports around the stationary bubble/drop. To induce
the latter to move, we introduce surfactants to endow the interface with
traction and to introduce asymmetric double layers across the film. With this
technique, we can induce bubble/drop motion with a speed that exceeds
single-phase electrolyte electrokinetic velocity. However, surfactant double
layers tend to be very thick such that they can completely suppress the current
necessary for electrokinetic flow at high bubble velocities when the film is
thin. There is hence a window of surfactant and electrolyte concentrations when
such multi-phase electrokinetic transport is possible. We estimate this window
theoretically by analyzing the intefacial problem,with capillary, viscous,
electrokinetic and Marangoni effects, via matched asymptotics. The results are
favorable compared to our experiments. <o:p>

&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Arial" size="4">In an earlier study, we have discovered
that double layer distortion can produce patterns on a electrode dissolving in
an electropolishing solution [Phys Rev B, 56. 2818(1997)]. Our solution of the
Poisson equation for the electric potential within the double layer indicates
that the potential gradient is higher at the crests of the interface and lower
at the troughs. Hence, polar or polarizable molecules in the electrolyte pack
preferentially at the crests and reduce their dissolution rate. This instability
is balanced by surface diffusion to produce patterns with length scale in the
100 nm range. Under specific conditions specified by our theory, perfectly
regimented hexagonal hills can be be produced on an aluminum electrode at that
length scale. If we then anodize the electrode, anodization pits around 10 nm in
diameter then grow at the troughs of the electropolishing patterns. The
preconditioned template then produces a very regimented hexagonal arrays of
nanoscale pits over a large (cmxcm) surface. These tailor-designed pits can be
used as membranes or as etching masks to make regimented pits on other
materials. We have successfully done so on silicone. <o:p>

miniature packed bed results when we electrophoretically pack nanoscale gold
particles, coated with ligands, into the above pit array in silicone. Such gold
particles are found to aggregate on alumina surfaces and seem to be stabilized
within the pits. Packing at this scale increases not only the surface area but
may also change the catalytic activity of the bio and chemical catalysts. Other
applications of this nanoscale device will be discussed. <o:p>
